# Xcode Languages for Sublime Text

This package is the successor of my [Xcode Project](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/xcode-project-language-for-sublime-text) and [Xcode Build Configuration](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/xcode-build-configuration-language-for-sublime-text) syntax definitions as suggested in [this issue](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/strings-resource-file-language-for-sublime-text/issues/1) and [this pull request](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/8391#issuecomment-956533976).

You might also be interested in my [String Resource File](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/strings-resource-file-language-for-sublime-text) package which is not specific to Xcode but the Apple platform to provide a syntax definition for localization files.
